# TrainingGroundV2

Welcome to TrainingGroundV2, updated into a turn-based dungeon crawler where your party of four faces off against powerful monsters and legendary bosses. This game features strategic choices, stamina management, as well as permadeath

## Game Overview

- Your party consists of **Warrior, Wizard, Elf, and Dwarf**, each with unique abilities, damage ranges, and stamina management.
- Battles are turn-based, with **two six-sided dice** determining hit chance and damage.
- Each turn, party members can **attack, heal, or quit**.
- Stamina regenerates every turn according to each character's regen factor.
- Defeat enemies to earn coins. Beware: **permadeath is enabled** â€” once a character falls, they are gone for good.
- Boss encounters appear after every 3 lesser enemies.
